Met on okcupid, in boston
First date trident book store because shu didn’t want a boring drinks date
Supposed to be a cooking demonstration, but he talked about sustainability for an hour and a half.
Then went to a bar, shu asked matt for an oktoberfest, almost didn’t have enough cash.
Then went to second bar, then third.
At this point shu didn’t think matt was interesting enough to want to talk to again.
Shaka’s pizza.
Eventually became “official”
second date: bowling alley
Matt was drawn to shu’s competitive nature and lack of subtlety
Third date: dominion w/ lydia and eugene
As matt was leaving shu shouted “were you gonna make a move!?”  and matt replied shocked “were YOU gonna make a move?”
Next breakfast shu managed to sit thru matt talking for an hour about the marvel comic universe.
Matt’s first christmas gift to shu was settler’s.
Matt’s first declaration of love came two weeks in, when he was drunk, after the bartender accidentally gave them shots of tequila instead of water.
Shu later requited the emotions by writing “I love you” on his back with her finger when she thought he was asleep.  But he wasn’t asleep and knew what she wrote.
3 or 4 months in, went to new orleans, got back together during the trip
Shu and matt have complementary skills
Got locked out of the hotel, shu freaks out, matt says let’s just hang out at bourbon street for 4 hrs till 6am, at which point they were able to get in.
Then hawaii trip.  Where shu drank 90% of a coconut and left the rest for matt, an event that matt won’t let shu forget.
Then shu left for bschool in michigan, 8 months in.
Matt would drive 12 hours each way to be with her.
Shu went to india for a summer, matt couldn’t get a visa, so they went to turkey.
During the whole time shu was like “are you gonna propose to me!?  Cuz I gotta be prepared.”
Then a year and a half later matt moved in w/ shu in michigan.
Matt surprised shu by sneaking into her apartment while her friend kept her busy out of the house.  While shu was out, matt decorated the living room with candles and ribbons.
So they lived there together for 1.5 years.
Matt tried to teach shu how to drive a stick shift during a michigan winter.
It was their first time living together.  And it was a little tough.  Matt had no friends nearby.  Shu was looking for internships.  They saw the movie “five year engagement”, which hit way too close to home.
After making it through the winter, they had a really nice summer playing board games.
The plan was to graduate and both get jobs in SF.  but matt wanted to stay on the east coast.  So they compromised and moved to NY.
2016, moved to chinatown, shu started work at accenture, matt started work at a fencing club
2017 spring the relationship really started to blossom
Matt didn’t want to propose cuz it seemed so sexist.

Then craigie on main.
The first one was a puzzle box made of legos, which shu proceeded to rip the top off.
They eventually made it to the boston commons, under the willow tree, and exchanged promises with each other.




Opening Address:

Jon: 

Before we begin, can we please have everyone silence their phones and put them
away. Thank you.

(Processional begins)

Jon: 

Good afternoon. For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Jon. I’ll be your
sermoner today.

A quick note before we get too far, Matt wrote most of this script. So, when the
jokes fail, blame him.

I’ve known Shu since our freshman year in college and Matt since shortly after
he started dating Shu. They have asked me officiate today.

That was a mistake. But I’ll do the best I can.

Shu and Matt’s story started when Matt picked a fight with Shu about a board
game (of all things) on OKCupid (of all places) that resulted in a date on
November 10, 2011 (of all days). Shu arrived late and remarked that they should
have met a day later on 11-11-11. That would have been special, Shu said. It
would only be special if they ever got married, Matt said, which seemed
unlikely.

Matt was obviously wrong. As he often is.

Over many board games, dinners and ill-advised tequilas, their relationship
rooted more strongly than either expected. Six years, three cities and 11 Marvel
movies later, they’re still together. And it’s still better that they didn’t
meet on 11-11-11, because that would have been one more day of not knowing each
other.

When Matt and Shu met seven years ago, neither was looking for a spouse. Shu had
just applied to business school. Matt was enjoying the single life.

By all logic, their romance should have been short. Instead, an unexpected seed
took root. And grew. And branched. And stretched its way all the way to today.

Over the past seven years, Shu and Matt’s love for and understanding of each
other has grown and matured. They have endured trials together; overcome
challenges. They have even survived assembling three apartment’s worth of Ikea
furniture.

Through all that, Matt and Shu learned that they prefer facing ordeals together,
side by side. So, they have decided to spend the rest of their lives together as
husband and wife.

We pause, now, for a few words from writer Neil Gaiman, who has attempted to
describe the unpredictable journey that is marriage. I hope you will keep his
words in your heart, and refer to them again during both good and challenging
times.

Ceremony Reading:

Lydia:
This is everything I have to tell you about love: nothing.
This is everything I've learned about marriage: nothing.

Only that the world out there is complicated,
and there are beasts in the night, and delight and pain,
and the only thing that makes it okay, sometimes,
is to reach out a hand in the darkness and find another hand to squeeze,
and not to be alone.

It's not the kisses, or never just the kisses: it's what they mean.
Somebody's got your back.
Somebody knows your worst self and somehow doesn't want to rescue you
or send for the army to rescue them.

It's not two broken halves becoming one.
It's the light from a distant lighthouse bringing you both safely home
because home is wherever you are both together.

So this is everything I have to tell you about love and marriage: nothing,
like a book without pages or a forest without trees.

Because there are things you cannot know before you experience them.
Because no study can prepare you for the joys or the trials.
Because nobody else's love, nobody else's marriage, is like yours,
and it's a road you can only learn by walking it,
a dance you cannot be taught,
a song that did not exist before you began, together, to sing.

And because in the darkness you will reach out a hand,
not knowing for certain if someone else is even there.
And your hands will meet, 
and then neither of you will ever need to be alone again.

And that's all I know about love.

Declaration of Intent:

Jon: 

Thank you Lydia.

And now, the declaration of intent.

Jon:

Do you, Matt, take Shu to be your spouse and companion? Will you support
her, in times of sickness and in health, in times of joy and sorrow? Do you
promise to comfort her during difficult times, to laugh with her during good
times, to be truthful with her always, and to love and cherish her for as long
as you both shall live?

Matt:

I do

Jon:

And Shu, do you take Matt to be your spouse and companion? Will you support
him, in times of sickness and in health, in times of joy and sorrow? Do you
promise to comfort him during difficult times, to laugh with him during good
times, to be truthful with him always, and to love and cherish him for as long
as you both shall live?

Shu:

I do

Jon:

We’ll proceed now to the vows. Shu and Matt have decided to write their own.

We’ll begin with Matt. Remember Matt, this is a wedding, not a roast.

[MATT’S VOWS]

Your turn, Shu.

[SHU’S VOWS]

Vows and Giving of the Rings

Jon:

May I please have the rings? Matt and Shu’s rings are an external and
visible sign of the internal bond of love which unites their two hearts.
May they serve as a seal of the vows Shu and Matt make to one another now.

(Jon gives Matt’s ring to Shu)

Shu (holding ring): 

I, Shu, take you, Matt, to be my spouse.
I promise / I will 
I promise / I will 
I promise / I will 
I promise / I will 
I promise to give you the best of myself, for I know that together we will build
a life far better than either of us could imagine alone.

(Shu puts ring on Matt)

(Jon gives Shu’s ring to Matt)

Matt: 

I, Matt, take you, Shu, to be my spouse. 
I promise / I will 
I promise / I will 
I promise / I will 
I promise / I will 
I promise to give you the best of myself, for I know that together we will build
a life far better than either of us could imagine alone.

(Matt puts ring on Shu)

Pronouncement: 

Shu and Matt, by the power vested in me by absolutely nobody, I now pronounce
you husband and wife - kissing is required!
