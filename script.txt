OPENING ADDRESS:

Jon:

Before we begin, can we please have everyone silence their phones and put them
away. Thank you.

(Processional begins)

Jon:

Good afternoon. For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Jonathan. I’ll
be your officiant today.

A quick note before we get too far, Matt wrote most of this script. So, when the
jokes fail, blame him.

I’ve known Shu since our freshman year in college and Matt since shortly after
he started dating Shu. They have asked me officiate today.

Shu and Matt's story is one of two very different people who complement each
other, and also a story of two very similar people who lives their lives with
truth and humor.

Shu and Matt's story started in Boston, where they met on OKCupid. Their first
date was on November 10, 2011.  During the date Shu remarked that they
should've met a day later on 11/11/11.  "That would have been special," she
said.  "It would only be special if we ever got married," Matt replied.  At
the time he thought it seemed unlikely.

Matt was obviously wrong.

That fateful first date started out at a cooking demonstration in a bookstore.
Shu chose it because she didn't want it to be a "boring drinks date".  But in
spite of that, after the demonstration was over, they went to a bar.  And then
a second, and then a third.

After all this, Shu didn't think Matt was interesting enough for her to want
to talk to him again.  But Matt convinced her to go on a second date with him
to a bowling alley.  They had a great time together and at the end of the
date, Matt gathered his courage to lean over to kiss Shu.  She mistakenly
thought Matt was going to hug her. As a result, Matt’s kiss landed on Shu’s
cheek.  Matt was impressed with Shu’s lack of subtlety. They departed without
saying anything about this cheek kiss, but they knew that the only solution
for this misplaced kiss would be for a real kiss to happen soon.  Their third
date was playing the card game Dominion at Shu’s home. Shu was living with
Lydia and Eugene at that time. It was a really long date. Lydia and Eugene
came back and left. The kiss still had not happened. Finally, as Matt was
leaving, Shu, who always speaks her true self, can’t help but asked Matt:
"Were you going to make a move!?"  To which Matt replied, "Were YOU gonna
make a move?!" They both laughed, and their first, real kiss happened.  

Matt's first declaration of love came soon after.  He was drunk at the time
because the bartender accidentally gave them shots of tequila instead of water.
Shu didn't say “I love you” back because, let’s face it, it is a big deal to
say it. However, Shu being Shu and always speaks her true self. Later that
night, when she thought Matt was asleep, she wrote "I love you" on his back
with her finger.  He wasn't asleep and knew exactly what she wrote.  Matt
didn't tell Shu he knew until some time later.  

Eight months in to their relationship, Shu moved to Michigan for b-school.  Matt
would drive 14 hours each way to see her.  Eventually, after a year and a
half, he grew tired of making the trip, and they decided to move in together.
Matt surprised Shu by sneaking into the apartment one week earlier. While
Shu’s friend kept her busy, Matt decorated the apartment with candles and
ribbons. His plan was to place the ribbon from the door, through the living
room, leading to himself on the couch. Upon unrolling the ribbon, Matt
realized that he only bought 3 yards and it was way too short to do what he
planned. So he cut the ribbon into pieces and placed them as originally
intended. Finally, Shu came home to a whole floor of pieces of ribbons.
That’s how they started living together.  

Shu graduated b-school in 2016. They decided to move to New York partially
because of me. Shu started working in consulting. Matt started working at a
fencing club.  Away from the brutal Michigan winters and back together with
their friends, Shu and Matt were enjoying a very happy life together and
their home has become the go to place for friends to play board games and eat
soup dumplings. After 2 years of wonderful time together in New York and in
the true nature of Shu and Matt, they decide they want to be married and will
propose to each other. No cliche and no going down on one knee. They said.
They would take a trip to Boston together. That would be it. The trip was
fully planned, but little did Shu know that with Lydia’s help, Matt secretly
prepared a scavenger hunt that would eventually end with himself, down on his
knee, proposing to Shu.  

The scavenger hunt required Shu to solve puzzles that took her all around
the city to find the next clue.  Shu took much longer time than what Matt
expected to solve the puzzles. Because Matt didn’t take into account how
nervous and unable to focus that Shu would be, upon realizing that Matt has
deviated from their plan of the mutual proposal  The first clue took Shu to
the bookstore where they had their first date.  There Shu found the second
clue, which took her to the first bar they went to on their first date.  The
next clue took her to their favorite board game store, then the doorway where
they shared that first real kiss.  The final location, though, was that big
willow tree in the Boston Commons, where they finally became engaged to each
other.

And so here we are.  Over many board games, dinners, and ill-advised tequilas,
their relationship has rooted more strongly than either ever expected. Seven
years, three cities, eleven Marvel movies, three apartments’ worth of Ikea
assembling, they’re still together.  And it’s still better that they didn’t
meet on 11-11-11, because that would have been one more day of not knowing
each other.

Through all that, Shu and Matt have faced and overcame obstacles side by
side. They have built a beautiful home filled with laughters. They encourage
and support each other to take on new challenges. They complement each other
with their strengths and aspirations.  

We pause now for a few words from bridesmaid Lydia.  Like me, Lydia also met Shu
during our freshman year of college.  She'll be quoting Neil Gaiman, who has
attempted to describe the unpredictable journey that is marriage.

CEREMONY READING:

Lydia:

This is everything I have to tell you about love: nothing.
This is everything I've learned about marriage: nothing.

Only that the world out there is complicated,
and there are beasts in the night, and delight and pain,
and the only thing that makes it okay, sometimes,
is to reach out a hand in the darkness and find another hand to squeeze,
and not to be alone.

It's not the kisses, or never just the kisses: it's what they mean.
Somebody's got your back.
Somebody knows your worst self and somehow doesn't want to rescue you
or send for the army to rescue them.

It's not two broken halves becoming one.
It's the light from a distant lighthouse bringing you both safely home
because home is wherever you are both together.

So this is everything I have to tell you about love and marriage: nothing,
like a book without pages or a forest without trees.

Because there are things you cannot know before you experience them.
Because no study can prepare you for the joys or the trials.
Because nobody else's love, nobody else's marriage, is like yours,
and it's a road you can only learn by walking it,
a dance you cannot be taught,
a song that did not exist before you began, together, to sing.

And because in the darkness you will reach out a hand,
not knowing for certain if someone else is even there.
And your hands will meet,
and then neither of you will ever need to be alone again.

And that's all I know about love.

DECLARATION OF INTENT:

Jon:

And now, the declaration of intent.

as you both shall live?

Matt:
