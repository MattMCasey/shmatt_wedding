OPENING ADDRESS:

Jon: 

Before we begin, can we please have everyone silence their phones and put them
away. Thank you.

(Processional begins)

Jon: 

Good afternoon. For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Jonathan. I’ll
be your officiant today.

A quick note before we get too far, Matt wrote most of this script. So, when the
jokes fail, blame him.

I’ve known Shu since our freshman year in college and Matt since shortly after
he started dating Shu. They have asked me officiate today.

Shu and Matt's story is one of TODO, often full of TODO, but always TODO.

Shu and Matt's story started in Boston, where they met on OKCupid. Their first
date was on November 10, 2011.  Shu remarked that they should've met a day later
on 11/11/11.  That would have been special, Shu said.  It would only be special
if they ever got married, Matt replied.  At the time he thought it seemed
unlikely.

Matt was obviously wrong.

That fateful first date started out at a cooking demonstration in a book store.
Shu chose it because she didn't want it to be a "boring drinks date".  But in
spite of that, after the demonstration was over, they went to a bar.  And then
a second, and then a third.

After all this, Shu didn't think Matt was interesting enough for her to want to talk to
him again.  But Matt convinced her to go on a second date with him to a bowling
alley.  It was here that Matt got to see more of Shu's true colors: a healthy
competitive nature and an impressive lack of subtlety.  Matt was already falling
for her.

Shu was also starting to have more serious feelings for Matt.

Their third date was playing the card game dominion with Lydia and Eugene.
After finishing the board game, after Lydia and Eugene had gone to bed, Shu and
Matt had a pleasant conversation.  As Matt was leaving, Shu shouted at him "were you going to
make a move!?"  To which Matt replied, shocked, "were YOU gonna make a move?!"
Matt ended up not going home that night.  The following morning during breakfast Shu managed to sit through Matt
talking for over an hour about the Marvel Comic Universe.

Matt's first declaration of love came soon after.  He was drunk at the time
because the bartender accidentally gave them shots of tequila instead of water.
Shu didn't immediately reciprocate the feelings, but later that night, when she
thought he was asleep, she wrote "I love you" on his back with her finger.  He
wasn't asleep and knew what she wrote.

Eight months in to their relationship, Shu moved to Michigan for b-school.  Matt
would drive 12 hours each way to be with her.  Eventually, after a year and a
half, he grew tired of making the trip, and they decided to move in together.
Matt surprised Shu by sneaking into the apartment while her friend kept her busy
out of the house.  While Shu was out, he decorated the living room with candles
and ribbons.  Shu nearly had a heart attack when she got back home.

Their relationship was really blossoming at this point.  During the summer they
took a vacation to Turkey.  The whole time throughout the trip Shu asked Matt
"Are you gonna propose to me?!  Cuz I gotta be prepared."  He didn't propose.
Yet.

Shu graduated b-school in 2016, and they moved to Chinatown together.  Shu
started working in consulting.  Matt started working at a fencing club.  After
living together in New York for a while, they both wanted to get married.  The
plan was to go back to Boston, and under the big willow tree in the Boston
Commons, they would propose to each other.  But Matt secretly had a scavenger
hunt prepared.

The scavenger hunt required Shu to solve puzzles that would take her all around
the city to find the next clue.  The first clue took them to the book store
where they had their first date.  There Shu found the second clue, which took
them to the first bar they went to on their first date.  Then their favorite
board game store, then the doorway where they shared their first kiss.  The
final location, though, was that big willow tree in the Boston Commons, where
they finally became engaged to each other.

And so here we are.  Over many board games, dinners and ill-advised tequilas,
their relationship has rooted more strongly than either ever expected. Seven
years, three cities, and eleven Marvel movies later, they’re still together.
And it’s still better that they didn’t meet on 11-11-11, because that would
have been one more day of not knowing each other.

When Matt and Shu met seven years ago, neither was looking for a spouse.  By
all logic, their romance should have been short. Instead, an unexpected seed
took root. And grew. And branched. And stretched its way all the way to
today.  Shu and Matt’s love for and understanding of each other has grown and
matured. They have endured trials together; overcome challenges. They have
even survived assembling three apartment’s worth of Ikea furniture.

Through all that, Matt and Shu learned that they prefer facing ordeals together,
side by side. So, they have decided to spend the rest of their lives together as
husband and wife.

We pause, now, for a few words from writer Neil Gaiman, who has attempted to
describe the unpredictable journey that is marriage. I hope you will keep his
words in your heart, and refer to them again during both good and challenging
times.

CEREMONY READING:

Lydia:

This is everything I have to tell you about love: nothing.
This is everything I've learned about marriage: nothing.

Only that the world out there is complicated,
and there are beasts in the night, and delight and pain,
and the only thing that makes it okay, sometimes,
is to reach out a hand in the darkness and find another hand to squeeze,
and not to be alone.

It's not the kisses, or never just the kisses: it's what they mean.
Somebody's got your back.
Somebody knows your worst self and somehow doesn't want to rescue you
or send for the army to rescue them.

It's not two broken halves becoming one.
It's the light from a distant lighthouse bringing you both safely home
because home is wherever you are both together.

So this is everything I have to tell you about love and marriage: nothing,
like a book without pages or a forest without trees.

Because there are things you cannot know before you experience them.
Because no study can prepare you for the joys or the trials.
Because nobody else's love, nobody else's marriage, is like yours,
and it's a road you can only learn by walking it,
a dance you cannot be taught,
a song that did not exist before you began, together, to sing.

And because in the darkness you will reach out a hand,
not knowing for certain if someone else is even there.
And your hands will meet, 
and then neither of you will ever need to be alone again.

And that's all I know about love.

DECLARATION OF INTENT:

Jon: 

Thank you Lydia.

And now, the declaration of intent.

Do you, Matt, take Shu to be your spouse and companion? Will you support
her, in times of sickness and in health, in times of joy and sorrow? Do you
promise to comfort her during difficult times, to laugh with her during good
times, to be truthful with her always, and to love and cherish her for as long
as you both shall live?

Matt:

I do

Jon:

And Shu, do you take Matt to be your spouse and companion? Will you support

as you both shall live?

Shu:
